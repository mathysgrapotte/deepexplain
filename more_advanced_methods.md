 __concept embeddings__
 In this recent paper, the authors propose to map input pictures to concept embeddings: 
 ie. generate embeddings for concepts like beak, belly, forehead, nape for bird classification, the outcome is based on the embeddings. 
 Finally, an importance score is assigned to each concept allowing the assessment of importance of each on the input. 
 (I just skimmed the paper for the journal club, I hope I didn't mess up anything)
