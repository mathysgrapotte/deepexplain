Welcome to the GitHub repository of our tutorial on explainability in machine learning!

This readme is intended to help navigate the tutorial that is organized in a modular manner. 
+ First, we give a birds eye view of the subject with emphasis on motivation, to be found in (add link)
+ Next, we also provide a (brief) general introduction on deep learning models and related utilities. This is just to make sure to get to the same page with novices. If you already worked with Pytorch then you may want to skip this part. [intro_to_basics.ipynb](intro_to_basics.ipynb)
+ In this [notebook](model_training.ipynb) and [script](data_and_models.py) we finally get down to business: the data loading utilities and basic models are implemented here at one place so that they don't have to be repeated over and over before the different explanatory methods.
+ Various explanatory methods are implemented in separate notebooks:

    .. Occlusion and deconvolutions [occlusion_deconvolution.ipynb](occlusion_deconvolution.ipynb)
    
    
    .. method2 (link)
    
+ In the final notebook, we synthesize what we've learned: compare methods and draw conclusions
